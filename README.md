Introduction
Comico is a simple sketching app for comic makers that has the layering functionalities, and inserting several panels. 
Features
1-	Panels
a.	Adding panels is easier than before, you can just holding alt and drag your mouse to add a new panel, or alternately you can click on the add panel button at the top bar.
b.	Resizing panels is done using two ways; either by dragging the corner points, or by holding ctrl, and right or down to resize. (Note that the ctrl button changes the mode into controlling mode as you will see)
c.	Moving panels can be done by two ways; getting into the controlling mode (holding ctrl button), and then dragging, or simply by control mode then arrows on keyboard (for delicate movements)
d.	Deleting the panel is simply done by selecting it (clicking) and then pressing delete on the keyboard.
e.	Each panel has layers, in which you can draw. Two basic layers are attached to each panel; Blue ink layer and ground layer. You can’t delete them but you can hide them (after you finish blue inking for example). We will talk about layers later.
f.	When you start sketching inside the panel, the line “belongs” to the panel, even if you go outside. Meaning, if you move the panel the line will move with it. Perfect for in extending to out of the panel sketching. 
g.	You can align panels by moving them finely using the keyboard shortcut or using the mouse
2-	Layers
a.	A layer is a logical element that belongs to a panel, and has multiple “lines”. 
b.	Layers are handled through the layers side panel
c.	When you click on a panel, layers are shown on the right side.
d.	You can add a layer, delete a layer, bring a layer on top, show/hide a layer
e.	Blue ink and ground layers can’t be deleted
f.	A small review thumbnail of the layer is viewable on the side panel
3-	Lines
a.	A line can belong to a layer (which belongs to a panel)
b.	We have 4 stroke sizes
c.	You can choose a color for your stroke
d.	If you are on the blue layer, the color is always blue
e.	When you move a panel, the line is moved with it
4-	Other features
a.	Eraser: can erase any drawing on the canvas
b.	Clear all: clears all drawings (can’t be undone)
c.	Save drawing feature: you can save the current sketch on your canvas into an image file
d.	Main canvas also has blue ink layer and ground layer
e.	Undo/Redo: Undo/redo functions implemented from the scratch, current supported actions:
i.	Add, delete, move, resize panel
ii.	Draw line
iii.	Add, delete layer
Assumptions
•	Each panel has its own layers
•	When you draw inside a panel, the line moves with this panel
•	Blue ink can’t be deleted but can be hidden
